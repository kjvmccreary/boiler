I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I am using the checklist at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-mvp-checklist.md to guide you and me. In my last session, I had you create a context document at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\context.md to get you up to speed.
This session needs to be about:
### 9. Outbox Idempotency & Schema Migration
* Add columns: ```IdempotencyKey (uuid)```, ```ProcessedAt (timestamp)```, ```Error (text)```.
* Add unique index ```(TenantId, IdempotencyKey)```.
This comes from C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md which I'm using to track the remaining items in my MVP.

In my last session, you created the game plan for this session. The description of the session and the specific stories are at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\status.md. We will use this document as our guide and we will keep it updated as we knock things out.

Please do a deep scan of my project structure as well as the documents described above. Additionally, you are to 100% of the code analysis and code generation. Also, when providing code, please provide complete files. Also, as we progress through the critical items of status.md, I would like you to strikethrough the items as we complete them.
When you are complete with your deep scan of both the backend and frontend, please generate the first tranche of code based on the "Story & Test Plan" section (around line 229) in status.md.
