I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I have made great progress. The backend for the MVP is basically complete. For the front end, the visual WF builder is functioning well. I am working against a list of remaining items at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md. You prepared that list. 

For a higher level reference, I am more or less following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-mvp-checklist.md. Specific to the front-end UI, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\WF_MVP_Frontend_Implementation_Guide.md. You created both of these documents.

It might make sense to do a full deep scan of my project before we resume. Once you are complete, I want to move forward with the items in C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md. Please start with section 4. Recommended Next Sprint (Priority Order) for the ordering / priority.

Additionally, you are to 100% of the code analysis and code generation. Also, when providing code, please provide complete files.
