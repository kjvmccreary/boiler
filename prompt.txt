I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I have made great progress. The backend for the MVP is basically complete. For the front end, I have been working on the visual WF builder with react flow. You and I just got to the point where the app will allow me to both CREATE a WF definition as well as SAVE an update to that WF definition.

I am more or less following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-mvp-checklist.md. Specific to the front-end UI, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\WF_MVP_Frontend_Implementation_Guide.md. You created both of these documents.

There was a lot of back and forth in getting to this point of saving WF Defs to the db. So I need to know where I stand in relation to those two documents and what is next for the WF MVP.

It might make sense to do a full deep scan of my project before we resume.
