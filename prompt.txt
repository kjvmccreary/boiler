I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I have made great progress. The backend for the MVP is basically complete. I just finished a round of test tightening for the backend. For the front end, the visual WF builder is functioning well. I would now like to focus on refactoring and tightening up the front end testing. You can find my front end at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\src\frontend\react-app\. 

For a higher level reference, I am more or less following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-mvp-checklist.md. Specific to the front-end UI, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\WF_MVP_Frontend_Implementation_Guide.md. You created both of these documents. For the remaining items in the MVP, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md beginning in section 4 of that doc.

Please do a full deep scan of my project understanding all of the files and folder structure before we resume. Pay particular attention to the front-end directory and the existing test fixtures there. Once you are complete, let me know. 

Additionally, you are to 100% of the code analysis and code generation. Also, when providing code, please provide complete files.
