I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I am using the checklist at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-mvp-checklist.md to guide you and me. You created a context document at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\context.md to get you up to speed.

My current effort is all of the items in status.md. You prepared this document for me and you can see that some of the items have already been completed. Broadly, this document is about getting the front end completely in alignment with the backend after major enhancements and refactoring of the backend. VERY IMPORTANT - all of the text fixtures in the front end pass. So as we work on the front end and/or the backend WE MUST ensure that the tests do not get broken; or if they do, we immediately update the test.

Please do a deep scan of my project structure as well as the documents described above. Additionally, you are to 100% of the code analysis and code generation. Also, when providing code, please provide complete files.
