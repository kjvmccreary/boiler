I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I have made great progress. The backend for the MVP is basically complete as is the frontend. I just finished critial testing for both the backend and the frontend. 

For a higher level reference, I am more or less following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-mvp-checklist.md. Specific to the front-end UI, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\WF_MVP_Frontend_Implementation_Guide.md. You created both of these documents. For the remaining items in the MVP, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md and am ready to move forward with section 5 - "RBAC & Permission Audit" of that document.

Please do a full deep scan of my project understanding all of the files and folder structure before we resume. Once you are complete, let me know. 

Additionally, you are to 100% of the code analysis and code generation. Also, when providing code, please provide complete files.
