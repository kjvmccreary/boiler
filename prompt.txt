I have completed a software application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\microservices-system-spec.md. I am now building a workflow service into the application as described at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\workflow-engine-dev-plan.md. I have made great progress. The backend for the MVP is basically complete. For the front end, the visual WF builder is allowing me to create and save WF Definitions. In my last session, I had you prepare a master list of remaining items to be complete with the MVP version of workflow. That list is at C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md. 

For a higher level reference, I am more or less following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-mvp-checklist.md. Specific to the front-end UI, I am following C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\WF_MVP_Frontend_Implementation_Guide.md. You created both of these documents.

It might make sense to do a full deep scan of my project before we resume. Once you are complete, I want to move forward - in order - with the items in C:\Users\mccre\dev\boiler\workflow\master-remaining.md.
