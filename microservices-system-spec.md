# Microservices Starter Application - System Specification

## Executive Summary

The Microservices Starter Application is a production-ready, enterprise-grade platform that provides a complete foundation for building scalable SaaS applications. Built on .NET 8.0 and React, the system features a sophisticated multi-tenant architecture with dynamic role-based access control (RBAC), allowing each tenant to define and manage their own security model while maintaining complete isolation from other tenants.

## System Architecture

### Core Architecture Pattern
The application implements a microservices architecture with the following key characteristics:
- **Service-Oriented Design**: Discrete, independently deployable services handling specific business domains
- **API Gateway Pattern**: Centralized entry point for all client requests with intelligent routing
- **Shared Libraries**: Common code and contracts shared across services for consistency
- **Database per Service**: Each service maintains its own data store when appropriate
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Services communicate through events and message queues where applicable

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: .NET 8.0 with ASP.NET Core Web API
- **Frontend**: React 18+ with TypeScript and Material-UI Pro
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Entity Framework Core and Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Caching**: Redis for distributed caching and performance optimization
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- **Containerization**: Docker with Docker Compose for orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging with Serilog and health check endpoints

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

### Tenant Isolation Model
The system implements a shared database, shared schema multi-tenancy model with complete data isolation:
- **Single Database Instance**: All tenants share the same PostgreSQL database
- **Row-Level Security**: PostgreSQL RLS policies ensure tenants can only access their own data
- **Tenant Context**: Every request carries tenant context through headers or JWT claims
- **Automatic Filtering**: Repository pattern automatically applies tenant filters to all queries
- **Cross-Tenant Protection**: Multiple layers prevent accidental cross-tenant data access

### Tenant Resolution Strategies
The system supports multiple tenant identification methods:
- **Subdomain-Based**: tenant1.app.com, tenant2.app.com
- **Header-Based**: Custom X-Tenant-Id header
- **JWT Claims**: Tenant information embedded in authentication tokens
- **URL Path**: /api/tenants/{tenantId}/resources

## Dynamic Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Permission System Architecture
The RBAC system provides granular, tenant-scoped access control:

**System-Level Components**:
- **Fixed Permissions**: Compile-time defined permissions following resource.action pattern (e.g., users.view, reports.export)
- **Permission Categories**: Logical grouping of related permissions for easier management
- **System Roles**: Platform-wide roles like SuperAdmin and TenantAdmin that exist across all tenants

**Tenant-Level Components**:
- **Dynamic Roles**: Each tenant can create custom roles with specific permission combinations
- **Role Templates**: Pre-defined role configurations that new tenants can adopt
- **Default Roles**: Automatically created roles for new tenants based on templates
- **Role Inheritance**: Optional hierarchical role structures within tenants

### Authorization Evaluation
The authorization system performs real-time permission evaluation:
- **JWT Claims Enhancement**: User permissions loaded and cached at authentication
- **Custom Authorization Handlers**: ASP.NET Core authorization handlers for permission-based access
- **Dynamic Policy Provider**: Runtime generation of authorization policies based on required permissions
- **Performance Optimization**: Redis caching with 5-minute TTL for permission lookups
- **Audit Trail**: Every authorization check logged for compliance and security analysis

### Permission Management
Comprehensive interfaces for managing the security model:
- **Role Management**: CRUD operations for tenant-specific roles
- **Permission Assignment**: Granular permission allocation to roles
- **User Role Assignment**: Multiple role support per user within a tenant
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient batch assignment of permissions and roles
