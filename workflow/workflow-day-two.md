Recommended Next Steps
1.	Implement Engine & Background Logic
•	Build WorkflowRuntime, ConditionEvaluator, AutomaticExecutor, HumanTaskExecutor, TimerExecutor, GatewayEvaluator, and TimerWorker.
•	Wire these into DI in Program.cs and connect to controller/service logic.
2.	Implement Service Layer
•	Create and wire up DefinitionService, InstanceService, TaskService, AdminService, and EventPublisher.
•	Refactor controllers to use these services for business logic.
3.	Security Policies
•	Implement Policies.cs and register policies in DI.
•	Ensure all endpoints are protected by correct RBAC policies.
4.	Frontend Stubs
•	Implement workflowService.ts and React components (DefinitionsTable, InstanceDetails, MyTasks) to exercise the API.
5.	Unit Tests
•	Add unit tests for definitions, instances, tasks, and admin operations.
6.	Smoke Test
•	Once engine and worker are in place, run the end-to-end flow described in the checklist.
7.	Documentation & Validation
•	Document API usage and add validation for workflow definitions (e.g., must have Start/End nodes).

You are well-structured and have all foundational pieces in place. The next major milestone is implementing the workflow engine, background processing, and service layer to enable real workflow execution.
